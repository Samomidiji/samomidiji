          <p>The Status of African Youth Report (<strong>SoAYR</strong>) provides an understanding of the current landscape of youth issues and what policies and programmes exist to address these issues among African Union (AU) Member States. It also examines the impact of interventions and aids in optimizing evidence-informed policy creation to strengthen the capacity of AU Member States to respond to youth development considerations and to produce stronger and more desirable results. The SoAYR is therefore crucial in delivering the goal of youth development and empowerment, which feeds into the overall development of the continent.</p>

The data for The Status of African Youth Report of each country are segmented into four pillars; DD1, DD2, DD3 and DD3.

        <h2 class="section-title">Conclusion</h2>
        <div class="project-text">
          <p>I was glad when I was contacted by the "Contractor" to work on this project for The African Union and was very eager to get to work as soon as possible. I was provided with the power BI format of the data and had to do a mini power bi training on Youtube before I could find my way around it. I learnt about a new environment as well as understanding complex data and breaking them down into smaller bit for proper visualization. While I had no say over the development (Coding) of the project, I ensured that I carried out some test to check out some key performances. 23 people participated and here below are how the project performed.</p>
          
          <h3 style="margin-top: var(--spacing-md); margin-bottom: var(--spacing-sm); font-size: var(--font-size-h2);">Key Performance Test</h3>
          <ul class="project-list">
            <li><strong>Ease of Navigation:</strong> 18 people found it easy to navigate the program and the feedback we got from the users led to me adding a search bar on the dashboard. Some testers made the observation that it would also be faster to just search for a specific country data.</li>
            <li><strong>Intuitiveness:</strong> On first use, 17 people found it very intuitive and know what exactly to look for. The major complains are the coded pillars (DD1, DD2, DD3, DD4). Not everyone understood what it meant, and this led to me including the title of each pillar on top of the dashboard.</li>
            <li><strong>Usefulness:</strong> 20 people agreed that the format in which the data was presented was readable and would be useful for them if they were to embark on a project that needs such data. They were impressed with the download option and layout of the downloadable pdf file.</li>
            <li><strong>Aesthetics:</strong> All 23 tester were of high praise of the User Interface design. It was on brand in terms of colors but also could be a stand alone product due to how clean and different it looks from traditional African union website.</li>
